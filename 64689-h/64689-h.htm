<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">A woman</span> in France got the spinal disease,</div>
<div class="verse">And from that sad moment she had no more ease;</div>
<div class="verse">To add to her anguish, she very soon found,</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, horrors! her back was becoming quite round.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
<div class="verse">The spasms of physical pain she endured,</div>
<div class="verse">Were keen, I assure you, and could not be cured;</div>
<div class="verse">But bad as these were, it seems, on the whole,</div>
<div class="verse">They could not compare with the pangs of her soul.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For I must inform you, O dear reader mine&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">(I&#8217;m in my third verse, and indeed it is time)&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">That our stylish Parisian was Fashion&#8217;s dear slave,</div>
<div class="verse">And to its sweet service her brain and time gave.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
<div class="verse">If she had been poet or artist or sage,</div>
<div class="verse">Or one of &#8220;the women,&#8221; so called, &#8220;of the age,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">With missions to Art, or the indigent poor,</div>
<div class="verse">Her crooked vert&eacute;bra she might well endure.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For &#8217;tis of no consequence, surely, I say,</div>
<div class="verse">If strong-minded women who flaunt in our day</div>
<div class="verse">Their rights to more freedom for work and for speech</div>
<div class="verse">Are placed by disease quite beyond the world&#8217;s reach.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
<div class="verse">Such women belong to that low, common kind</div>
<div class="verse">Who assert that an active condition of mind</div>
<div class="verse">Or of hands (me! how vulgar!) does make, after all,</div>
<div class="verse">What we a true woman can worthily call.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But say, of what consequence, pray, can it be</div>
<div class="verse">If females with such vulgar notions, you see,</div>
<div class="verse">Are forced to stop work and all bold agitations</div>
<div class="verse">Of questions important to churches and nations</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
<div class="verse">Because of a weakness of brain and of spine?</div>
<div class="verse">(Both organs, alas! being in a <i>decline</i>.)</div>
<div class="verse">It matters but little, if women like these,</div>
<div class="verse">Are deprived of all usefulness, comfort, and ease.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But when a fair daughter of Fashion&mdash;a treasure,</div>
<div class="verse">Who lives but to seek and to find her own pleasure,</div>
<div class="verse">A victim becomes to keen pains that do rack,</div>
<div class="verse">To pains that quite ruin the shape of her back&mdash;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
<div class="verse">Here, here is a tale that makes the heart bleed!</div>
<div class="verse">A tale wholly fit for a poet indeed!</div>
<div class="verse">Before I have finished, however, you&#8217;ll find</div>
<div class="verse">That sunlight with shadow is herein combined.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">At present the shadow rests over my maid,</div>
<div class="verse">While wrapped in reflection she sits in the shade.</div>
<div class="verse">Her brain being small, is quite like the pot</div>
<div class="verse">Which, owing to smallness, so soon became hot.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
<div class="verse">It seems at this moment, in truth, quite on fire,</div>
<div class="verse">Harassed as it is with the spasms of ire,</div>
<div class="verse">That seize it in thinking of hopes all destroyed,</div>
<div class="verse">Her figure quite ruined! her future a void!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For I must inform you, our &#8220;charmante Fran&ccedil;aise,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Deluded as all of us were in those days,</div>
<div class="verse">Considered it really a feminine charm,</div>
<div class="verse">To carry the figure&mdash;including the arm&mdash;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
<div class="verse">According to Nature in some slight degree,</div>
<div class="verse">With freedom and unstudied grace, don&#8217;t you see?</div>
<div class="verse">A form finely poised, and free in its motion,</div>
<div class="verse">Is surely a sign&mdash;at least, such was the notion&mdash;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Of youth and of health. Even some thought that grace</div>
<div class="verse">Had a meaning and charm quite beyond a doll face.</div>
<div class="verse">But all such ideas have of course now gone by</div>
<div class="verse">In times when the fashions do Nature defy.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
<div class="verse">As I was just saying, our &#8220;charmante Fran&ccedil;aise,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Deluded as all of us were in those days,</div>
<div class="verse">Was tortured with agony now at the thought</div>
<div class="verse">Of the change which the spinal affection had wrought</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In her whose fine figure, a short time ago,</div>
<div class="verse">Arrayed in rare furbelows, made such a show</div>
<div class="verse">On the &#8220;Boulevards;&#8221; also when on her white mare,</div>
<div class="verse">Erect and in &#8220;stove-pipe&#8221; she pranced with the air</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
<div class="verse">Which marks the great &#8220;parvenues&#8221; out as that class</div>
<div class="verse">Whose eyes, looking over you, say, &#8220;Let me pass!</div>
<div class="verse">Do you know who I am? I&#8217;ve a carriage and four,</div>
<div class="verse">A poodle and twenty-five servants and more.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But I am digressing. The subject is great,</div>
<div class="verse">And I fear I shall never get through at this rate.</div>
<div class="verse">To return to &#8220;mes moutons,&#8221; I mean to my maid;</div>
<div class="verse">We left her, remember, in wrath and in shade.</div><p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She sat in the shade, for she feared that the light</div>
<div class="verse">Would bring to her vision that horrible sight,</div>
<div class="verse">A female with vertebral column askew,</div>
<div class="verse">And now as she sat here she dreaded the view.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But at the next moment a thought bright as fire,</div>
<div class="verse">Seemed to burn in her eyes and to chase away ire;</div>
<div class="verse">She rose, in a tremor of joy, from the gloom,</div>
<div class="verse">And opening the shutters, made bright the whole room.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
<div class="verse">She then all at once did proceed, with a rush,</div>
<div class="verse">To fasten a pillow, with cheeks all a-flush,</div>
<div class="verse">Just under her skirt, quite behind at the back,</div>
<div class="verse">And then she donned quickly a hat and a sack&mdash;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Seized quicker a parasol; then without fear,</div>
<div class="verse">She faced the long mirror with eyes all a-cheer</div>
<div class="verse">With some inspiration, that strangely did lend</div>
<div class="verse">To a spine badly bent an additional bend.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
<div class="verse">Pray what was she doing? you ask, all amazed,</div>
<div class="verse">Perhaps you imagine the girl was quite crazed,</div>
<div class="verse">Or trying a cure&mdash;and that&#8217;s madness enough&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">With &#8220;similia similibus&#8221; ideas and such stuff.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh, no! my dear Reader; she&#8217;s simply intent</div>
<div class="verse">On proving in practice the worth of a bent,</div>
<div class="verse">Which entered her mind a few moments ago,</div>
<div class="verse">And set all her brain and her heart in a glow.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
<div class="verse">In short, all creations of genius, you know,</div>
<div class="verse">Originate, so they say, always just so;</div>
<div class="verse">Quite all of a sudden, undreamt of, they&#8217;re born</div>
<div class="verse">In the brain which seeks after to give them a form.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The form which our heroine sought now to give</div>
<div class="verse">To her noble creation was, sure as I live,</div>
<div class="verse">A crook in the back and a crook in the arm,</div>
<div class="verse">And with these same crooks she means yet to charm</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
<div class="verse">Her circle of former admirers and friends,</div>
<div class="verse">And, after a ripe preparation, intends</div>
<div class="verse">To make her &#8220;<i>d&eacute;but</i>&#8221; in a style very new,</div>
<div class="verse">Unknown to the crowd or e&#8217;en the rare <i>few</i>.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh, view her, as now she continues to pass</div>
<div class="verse">Up and down, while she studies herself in the glass!</div>
<div class="verse">With parasol raised very high in the air,</div>
<div class="verse">And spine really taking a curve, I declare,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
<div class="verse">Exceeding by far the long crook that disease</div>
<div class="verse">Had wrought there in hours void of rest and of ease,</div>
<div class="verse">And yet, I assure you, her face glows with smiles,</div>
<div class="verse">While practicing poses the hours she beguiles.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But while I still watched her, a cloud thin as air,</div>
<div class="verse">Passed over the features that now seemed so fair;</div>
<div class="verse">With eyes on the mirror, I heard her exclaim,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Oh! dear me! oh! dear me! I&#8217;ve lost it again.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
<div class="verse">She takes a new bend&mdash;then cries, &#8220;That&#8217;s not it!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Here, dear reader mine, she was seized with a fit</div>
<div class="verse">Of abdominal colic, which only did serve</div>
<div class="verse">To add, you perceive, to her back a new curve.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The full extra curve produced by the pain,</div>
<div class="verse">Brought strangely the smiles to her features again;</div>
<div class="verse">She cried, &#8220;Oh! kind Providence surely did send</div>
<div class="verse">This spasm to give me the &#8216;true Grecian bend!&#8217;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;The &#8216;true Grecian bend!&#8217; here, here is a name</div>
<div class="verse">Which soon will acquire a most glorious fame!</div>
<div class="verse">It hides my poor hump altogether, you see,</div>
<div class="verse">And a leader of fashion again I will be!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Since the colic referred to, by Providence sent,</div>
<div class="verse">Two weeks had gone by, and our damsel had bent</div>
<div class="verse">Whatever of strength she possessed to attain</div>
<div class="verse">The &#8220;true Grecian bend,&#8221; and it was not in vain.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
<div class="verse">The day now arrived for the startling &#8220;d&eacute;but,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">And our heroine smiling emerged to the view</div>
<div class="verse">Of the Boulevards, where &#8220;tout le monde&#8221; in a maze</div>
<div class="verse">At the strange apparatus in wonder did gaze.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This strange apparatus, as I before said,</div>
<div class="verse">Perched on heels that supported a hump on the head,</div>
<div class="verse">A hump on the back and a crook in the arm</div>
<div class="verse">Presented a vision entitled to charm</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
<div class="verse">The eyes of all artists; for sure &#8217;tis their duty</div>
<div class="verse">To recognize always the true curve of beauty;</div>
<div class="verse">And who can deny that here was a curve</div>
<div class="verse">Sufficiently curving as model to serve?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The world, as I said, at first in a maze,</div>
<div class="verse">With sneers at the strange apparatus did gaze;</div>
<div class="verse">But when this same world at last did discover</div>
<div class="verse">The &#8220;strange apparatus&#8221; was she, and no other,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
<div class="verse">Who only last year the gay fashion did lead,</div>
<div class="verse">And lived on the Boulevard Malesherbes indeed!</div>
<div class="verse">They suddenly found that her present strange style</div>
<div class="verse">Was but a new fashion she&#8217;d set all the while.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Upon the discovery that, without doubt,</div>
<div class="verse">The humps and the crooks were &#8220;<i>the</i> latest out;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">With common accord the dear feminine gender,</div>
<div class="verse">At once set to work in trying to render</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
<div class="verse">Themselves in appearance as near as could be,</div>
<div class="verse">To her who was now all the fashion, you see.</div>
<div class="verse">So where only yesterday out on the street</div>
<div class="verse">But one crooked female you might chance to meet,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To-day there existed a hundred at least,</div>
<div class="verse">Who made up a pantomime, truly a feast</div>
<div class="verse">Of color and form, to him who delights</div>
<div class="verse">In fine graceful contours and that sort of sights;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
<div class="verse">And yet it is proper that I should confess</div>
<div class="verse">(For to know &#8220;what is what&#8221; I did never profess),</div>
<div class="verse">The sight of curved females at first raised a question</div>
<div class="verse">Which seemed to me worthy some solid reflection.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The question was this: if &#8217;tis true as averred,</div>
<div class="verse">Human origin may to the ape be referred,</div>
<div class="verse">Then we are now turning, I boldly declare,</div>
<div class="verse">To monkeys again. Pray look at the air</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
<div class="verse">Of that monkey the organ-man carries about.</div>
<div class="verse">Gaze but a short moment and you will find out</div>
<div class="verse">When standing, his back just describes the outline</div>
<div class="verse">Of that fashionable female, in garments so fine.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Does not this resemblance, oh, tell me, I pray,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twixt apes and the fashionable dames of to-day,</div>
<div class="verse">Suggest to your mind the identical question,</div>
<div class="verse">Which seemed to me worthy some solid reflection?</div>

<div class="verse">At first from scorn and dejection, but now</div>
<div class="verse">My feelings are altered entirely, I vow.</div>

<div class="stanza">

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
